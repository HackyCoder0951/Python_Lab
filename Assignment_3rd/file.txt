A file operation starts with the file opening. 
At first, open the File then Python will start the operation. 
File opening is done with the open() function in Python. 
This function will accepts two arguments, file name and access mode in which the file is accessed. 
When we use the open() function, that time we must be specified the mode for which the File is opening. 
The function returns a file object which can be used to perform various operations like reading, writing, etc.
